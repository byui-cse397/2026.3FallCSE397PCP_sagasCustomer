 * What is here is the minimum needed to show the right criteria next to the
 * right components on the /dev page: which snapshot exhibits the situation,
 * which claim or record to look at, and one line on what has to be true.
 *
 * These are direction, not specification. They say what must not happen. How
 * your interface satisfies them is your design, and most of what you build will

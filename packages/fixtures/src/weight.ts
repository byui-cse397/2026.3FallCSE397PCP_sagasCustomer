/**
 * A stand-in for scoring claims. This is not the real thing.
 *
 * It exists so claims have some order to display in and something to label
 * them with. It's simple arithmetic, picked to be obviously provisional.
 *
 * Working out how weight and confidence should really be calculated is the
 * intelligence layer's deliverable. Don't build on this. It gets deleted.
 *
 * Two things in here are worth keeping, because they are rules about the
 * problem rather than proposed answers to it:
 *
 *   Edges are the strong signals. An extension pushes a claim up, a dispute
 *   pushes it down, and a resolution (not in the contract yet) would push both
 *   branches it reconciles up. So a claim's weight moves in both directions
 *   over time rather than only accumulating.
 *
 *   Passovers (`sounds_right`, `dont_know`, `dont_care`) are the soft signals
 *   and matter most for what gets suggested to whom. Here agreement, a
 *   `sounds_right` passover, adds only a small, capped nudge, and it never
 *   counts as independent support.

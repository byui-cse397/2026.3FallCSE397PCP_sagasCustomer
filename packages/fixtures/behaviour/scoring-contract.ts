/**
 * Being retired. The rules the intelligence layer's scorer answers to are in
 * `../scoring/rules.ts`, and they read the graph instead of a list of counts.
 * This file stays only to check the placeholder in `src/weight.ts`, and several
 * of its rules no longer match the model.
 *
 * The rules any scoring implementation has to obey.
 *
 * `src/weight.ts` is a placeholder and it gets deleted. This file is what
 * survives it. It says nothing about how to score a claim and everything about
 * what a correct scorer may not do, so it still holds when the arithmetic in
 * there is replaced by something real.
 *
 * HOW TO USE IT
 *
 * Write your scorer so it matches the `Scorer` interface below, then point this
 * suite at it from your own test file:
 *
 *   import { describe } from 'vitest';
 *   import { runScoringRules } from '@sagas/fixtures/behaviour';
 *   import { myScorer } from '../src/my-scorer';
 *
 *   runScoringRules('my scorer', myScorer);
 *
 * If a rule fails, one of two things is true. Either the scorer is wrong, or
 * the rule is. Both happen. If you think it is the rule, open a pull request
 * against this file with your reasoning rather than editing it in your fork,
 * because every team is held to the same list and a rule that only some teams
 * follow is not a rule.
 *
 * WHY THESE RULES AND NOT OTHERS
 *
 * Every one of them is a way the archive could quietly go wrong while every
 * unit test still passed. A scorer that ranks by headcount, or that lets a
 * long-standing contributor outrank a newcomer's better-supported claim, is
 * not buggy in any way a normal test would catch. It just produces an archive
 * that agrees with whoever was already loudest.

/**
 * Every rule below is prefixed, and the prefix says how much weight to give it.
 *
 *   required           This project will not merge a scorer that fails one of
 *                      these. There are seven, and most are closer to definitions
 *                      of a working function than positions on anything: the
 *                      same input gives the same answer, the output is a real
 *                      number, more disagreement does not raise a score.
 *
 *   open to argument   Something the sponsor currently thinks, written down so
 *                      it is checkable instead of assumed. There are three. A
 *                      failure might be a bug in your scorer and it might be
 *                      you disagreeing, and disagreeing is a check-in
 *                      conversation rather than a quiet deletion.
 *
 * This suite was drafted before any of it had been tried against a real
 * claim, and nobody here has solved the scoring problem. Treat it as a
 * starting point rather than a description of how
 * scoring ought to work. The algorithm is yours, and these rules should
 * not be the reason you build something a particular way.

/* WHAT THESE RULES DO NOT COVER                                       */
/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ */

/**
 * Read this before you treat a green run as a sound algorithm.
 *
 * Every rule below is a property of a scalar function over one claim's own
 * inputs. None of them know what an edge is. The graph is untested, and these
 * are the questions nobody here has answered:
 *
 *   Does support travel along extension edges, and how far? Right now a claim
 *   knows how many extensions it has and nothing about how strong they are.
 *
 *   Can a chain of extensions feed back on itself, so that a claim ends up
 *   corroborating itself around a cycle?
 *
 *   How independence is worked out from the graph. `independentRecordCount`
 *   is a stand-in that counts records other contributors brought. Whether two
 *   records share a source (the same telling, heard twice) is not visible to it.
 *
 * This is deliberate rather than forgotten. Testing those means fixing what a
 * propagation algorithm looks like: what it takes, what it returns, whether it
 * runs to a fixed point. That is the intelligence layer's design decision,
 * not something a scaffold should make on their behalf.
 *
 * So: bring your propagation model to a check-in once you have one, and we will
 * write the graph rules together. An incomplete suite that looks complete is
 * more dangerous than no suite, which is why this is written down here rather
 * than left for somebody to notice.

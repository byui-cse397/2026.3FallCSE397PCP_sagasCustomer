# Experience layer backlog

The work for this layer, grouped into epics. Each epic starts with a few stories
and gains more at each specification meeting, as the earlier ones land. If an
epic looks thin, that is why.

**How to read a story.** Each `###` heading is one story, written so it can be
pasted into a GitHub issue as it is: the heading is the title and everything
under it is the body. Whether your team tracks them as issues is up to you.

- **Goal** says what the story is for.
- **Done when** is what gets checked at the specification meeting.
- **Not in this story** is there so a story does not quietly grow.
- **Status** says whether it can start now, and if not, which stories it waits
  on.
- **Read first** names documents to read before starting, if any.

A story that turns out to be wrong, too big or unclear is normal. Say so in the
check-in note and it gets rewritten.

Status key: **Ready** (can start now), **Later** (written, waiting on the
stories named), **Draft** (direction only, gets detail at a specification
meeting).

When a story says "write down why", put it in the pull request description.

---

## Sprint one

The first sprint under `STATEMENT-OF-WORK.md`, two or three issues per
workstream. It replaces epic A as the first sprint. Epic A's stories are still
below, and the table "Where the earlier stories went" says where each one went.

### P1 · The pipeline on GitHub Actions (Ema)

**Workstream:** Platform. **Status:** Ready

**Goal.** The checks that already exist run in the fork, block a merge when they
fail, and are ready to deploy from.

**Done when:**

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (typecheck, lint, acceptance criteria, tests) runs
  on every pull request in the fork, and a failure blocks the merge.
- The team's own workflow files say in comments what each job is for.
- A deploy step is ready to switch on once P2 is approved. Switching it on is
  part of P3.

**Not in this story.** A preview for each pull request, and the full app's
hosting. Both come later, by proposal.

**Read first.** "Turn on the upstream watch" in `docs/START-EXPERIENCE-LAYER.md`,
which covers switching Actions on in a fork.

### P2 · Hosting and domain proposal (Ema)

**Workstream:** Platform. **Status:** Done. The landing page runs on Cloudflare
Workers, on the free plan, at `sagasproject.org`. See "Deploying it" in
`README.md`.

**Goal.** A recommendation, with costs, for where the landing page and later the
full app run, and what the domain is.

**Done when:** a short written proposal covering:

- At least three hosting options with free tiers, compared on what this project
  needs: a static page now, then a Next.js app, a small API and a Postgres
  database. Say what each costs per month and where its free tier ends.
- A shortlist of available domain names with their yearly price.
- A recommendation for each, and why.

**Not in this story.** Signing up for anything. The sponsor signs up once the
proposal is approved.

### P3 · The landing page (Ema, Canon)

**Workstream:** Platform, with the copy from Design (De2). **Status:** Ready to
build. P2 is approved. Deploying waits for the copy to be approved.

**Goal.** A small public page for Sagas, deployed by the team's own pipeline.

**Done when:**

- A small static app in the fork (for example `apps/landing`) builds, and
  merging to the main branch deploys it.
- The copy is the one the sponsor approved (De2), and nobody outside the team
  sees it before that.
- No organisation is named, and anything invented is marked as invented.

**Not in this story.** A sign-up form or a changelog section. Both come later.

### Da1 · The read model against a local database

**Workstream:** Data. **Status:** Ready

**Goal.** `packages/read-model` answers from Postgres instead of JSON files,
and nothing that calls it has to change.

**Done when:**

- The local database (`pnpm db:up` in `apps/ui-api`) holds the corner shop, and
  `listSites()` and `getSiteState()` read from it.
- `/dev` looks the same as before.
- A note on the data model: what is stored, what is worked out per request, and
  a proposal on two open questions. Should the database store events (each
  thing a person did) or snapshots (what a site looks like at one moment)? And
  where does a claim's weight live, given that weight is moving onto details?

**Not in this story.** Hosting the database.

**Read first.** Story A5 below, and the comments in
`packages/read-model/src/index.ts`. If you started A5, that work carries over.
A5 now models sections from the shared contract and groups claims by source
record.

### Da2 · A seed script for any database

**Workstream:** Data. **Status:** Later. Needs Da1.

**Goal.** Loading the fixtures into a database is one command, so moving to a
hosted database later only means a new connection string.

**Done when:** one script loads every fixture site into whichever Postgres
database a connection string points at, and running it twice does not duplicate
anything.

### Da3 · What the page needs from the data

**Workstream:** Data. **Status:** Replaced by Da8 in sprint two.

**Goal.** A written list of what the map and the narrative page need that the
fixtures do not have yet.

**Done when:** the list exists, each item says which screen needs it, and
anything that should be shared is opened as a pull request upstream with the
reason.

### M1 · The map and the list(Sam)

**Workstream:** Map and discovery. **Status:** Ready

**Goal.** Old stories B1 and B3 together: a real map with the fixture sites as
pins, and a list view that has everything the map has.

**Done when:** see B1 and B3 below. Both have to work, with and without a
Mapbox token.

### M2 · Search by name and by map area

**Workstream:** Map and discovery. **Status:** Later. Needs M1.

**Goal.** Somebody can find a site by typing part of its name, or by moving the
map.

**Done when:** a search field filters sites by name, other names and address,
and the list follows the area the map shows. It works from the keyboard.

### M3 · Site icons

**Workstream:** Map and discovery. **Status:** Ready

**Goal.** A pin says at a glance what kind of place it is, and roughly how well
documented, without a number. This replaces the pin band in B1.

**Done when:** a small set of icons, in the style the design workstream is
working toward, used on the map and the list.

### N1 · The corner shop at t3 as a page

**Workstream:** Narrative page. **Status:** Ready. Your fork already has the
contract it needs.

**Goal.** The site page from `PAGE-MODEL.md`, built in the app.

**Done when:**

- The site's sections render with their headings and passages, from
  `sections` and `compositions` in the contract.
- A site with no sections shows its records on their own, without looking
  broken.
- Both readings of the disputed date can be seen side by side.

**Read first.** `PAGE-MODEL.md`, then open `page-model.html`.

### N2 · A phrase opens the claims behind it

**Workstream:** Narrative page. **Status:** Later. Needs N1.

**Goal.** Selecting a phrase in a passage shows the claims it rests on.

**Done when:**

- Selecting a phrase shows the claims named by its span, ordered by weight,
  with extensions under the claim they add to.
- When the span names details, the detail's words are highlighted in the claim.
- It works from the keyboard, and the reader can get back to where they were.

### N3 · Step from t0 to t3

**Workstream:** Narrative page. **Status:** Later. Needs N1.

**Goal.** Watch the page change as the site's history arrives.

**Done when:** a control moves between the four states and the page re-renders,
including t0 with no sections. It is a tool for building and checking, so it can
live on `/dev`.

### De1 · Wireframes for the landing page and the map (Michael)

**Workstream:** Design. **Status:** Ready

**Goal.** The other main screens, built on the page model.

**Done when:**

- Wireframes, sketched or in a design tool, for the landing page and the map
  with search, each with a short note on what a person sees when there is
  almost nothing at a place.
- A first set of design tokens (colours, spacing, type sizes) that the
  components use (from story A1).

**Read first.** `PAGE-MODEL.md`, and "Design direction" in
`STATEMENT-OF-WORK.md`.

### De2 · Landing page copy (Michael)

**Workstream:** Design. **Status:** Ready

**Goal.** The words on the landing page, ready for the sponsor to approve.

**Done when:** a draft goes to the sponsor in the questions issue. It names no
organisation and marks anything invented.

### De3 · What is missing and what would be nice (Michael)

**Workstream:** Design. **Status:** Ready

**Goal.** A list of what the product lacks, from the side of somebody using it.

**Done when:** the list is brought to the specification meeting.

### Where the earlier stories went

| Old story                    | Where it went                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A1 component library         | Built as the page and the map need parts. The tokens are in De1                                  |
| A2 front-end test setup      | Later, as component tests and an accessibility check in the pipeline (see the statement of work) |
| A3 Storybook investigation   | Later. See "The backlog behind sprint one" in `STATEMENT-OF-WORK.md`                             |
| A4 mockups                   | De1, now that the site page has a page model                                                     |
| A5 entity relationship model | Da1. Keep what has been done                                                                     |
| B1, B3                       | M1                                                                                               |
| C0                           | Da1 and Da2                                                                                      |

### Template for a new story

Copy this into a new issue, or under an epic below.

```
### <short id> · <what it does, in a few words>

**Workstream:** <one of the five>. **Status:** Ready / Later. Needs <ids> / Draft

**Goal.** <one or two sentences: what it is for>

**Done when:**
- <something checkable at the specification meeting>
- <...>

**Not in this story.** <what it could grow into, and should not>

**Read first.** <documents, if any>
```

## Sprint two

The landing page is live, so the next focus is the full app, starting with
the map. Some of these stories come from a conversation the sponsor had with
three archivists about the project. Nothing here is assigned. Pick owners as
you finish your current work, and say in your Friday update who took what.
There's more here than the team can finish in one sprint, on purpose, so
nobody runs out.

### P4 · Host the full app, free, and not on Vercel

**Workstream:** Platform. **Status:** Ready

**Goal.** The full app, `apps/web`, needs a home that's free while it's being
built, low-cost and sustainable for an open source project after that, and
not on Vercel. It's a challenge of the same kind as the landing page.

The first thing to find out is whether Cloudflare can serve dynamic pages. It
worked well for the landing page, which was static, and the full app isn't.

**Done when** you've answered that question, and written a short comparison
of three or four options, Cloudflare included: what each costs at today's
traffic and at a hundred times that, what would make it stop being free, and
which you'd pick and why. Deploying is P7's job once the sponsor agrees to a
choice. The app uses Next.js, and moving away from it needs a one-page
decision record, as the statement of work says.

**Not in this story.** The landing page's own address. Any real record.
Calling another team's API.

### P5 · Keep the landing page in step with releases

**Workstream:** Platform. **Status:** Later. Needs P7. Ongoing after that.

**Goal.** Whenever a new version of the full app is published, the landing
page says what's new, with the copy approved the same way as before.

**Done when** the first published version after P7 shows on the landing page.

### P6 · An address for the full app

**Workstream:** Platform. **Status:** Ready to propose. Setting it up waits
for P7.

**Goal.** The full app needs its own address next to the landing page, such
as a subdomain. Propose one, and say what it needs in DNS and from the hosting
chosen in P4.

**Done when** the sponsor has agreed the address and the app answers on it.
The Cloudflare token can't change DNS, so ask in the questions issue for the
DNS change.

### P7 · Publish the full app, and decide on staging

**Workstream:** Platform. **Status:** Later. Needs the sponsor's agreement on
P4.

**Goal.** Publish `apps/web` from the pipeline to a preview address that
search engines skip, using fixture data only. Decide along the way whether the
project needs a staging environment (a second copy for checking changes before
they reach the preview), or whether publishing every merge to main is enough.
The sponsor's lean is that main is enough if it works.

**Done when** merges publish the app the way the decision says, the decision
and its reason are in a one-page decision record, and the README says how to
roll back. Publishing can run from GitHub Actions on every merge, or one
person can manage releases for everyone. Either is fine.

### Da8 · What each screen needs, from the people building it

**Workstream:** Data. **Status:** Ready. Replaces Da3.

**Goal.** The data workstream holds the data behind every screen the team
builds: the state a screen keeps while someone uses it, and the storage
behind it. So each map and narrative page story has a matching data story,
done with whoever is building that screen. Da5 to Da7 are the first ones. This
story starts it: sit with the people working on the components (De7), the map
and the narrative page, and write down, for each screen, the data it shows and
the state it keeps.

How state is managed (hooks, providers, a store library or something else) is
the data workstream's choice. Write down why in a one-page decision record.
Shapes come from the contract's Zod types. Don't write your own copies of
them.

**Done when** the list is in the fork, each item names its screen, and
anything the fixtures don't have is asked in the questions issue, with the
reason.

### Da5 · The map's data and state

**Workstream:** Data. **Status:** Later. Needs Da1. Matches M1.

**Goal.** One read-model call returns what a pin and a list item need, and the
map's state (which site is selected, what area is in view) lives in one place
that the map and the list both use.

**Done when** M1 draws from it, and selecting a site in the list selects it on
the map, and the other way round.

### Da6 · The narrative page's data and state

**Workstream:** Data. **Status:** Later. Needs Da1. Matches N1 and N4.

**Goal.** One read-model call returns what a site's narrative page needs: its
records with who brought them, the claims and their details, and where people
disagree. The page's state (which phrase is open, which record is expanded)
lives in one place. The narrative page workstream builds the interactions;
this story holds the state they use.

**Done when** the corner shop's narrative page renders from it.

### Da7 · Moving between the map and a site

**Workstream:** Data. **Status:** Later. Needs Da5 and Da6. Matches M4.

**Goal.** Opening a site from the map and coming back keeps where the reader
was: the same area in view and the same site selected. A link to a site works
on its own too.

**Done when** it works with the back button, and a shared link opens the
right site.

### Da4 · The hosted database, when the app needs one

**Workstream:** Data, with Platform. **Status:** Later. Starts when the app
needs it.

**Goal.** Da1 puts the read model on a local database. When the published app
needs a hosted one, connect it to the project's hosted Postgres, which exists
but isn't connected to anything yet, and work out with whoever did P4 how the
app reaches it.

**Done when** the published preview reads from the hosted database, with
fixture data loaded by Da2's script. Ask the sponsor for access when it's
time.

**Not in this story.** Any real record.

### M4 · A pin opens its site

**Workstream:** Map and discovery. **Status:** Later. Needs M1 and N1.

**Goal.** M1, from sprint one, is the map story to start with. It works with
your own free Mapbox token, as `SETUP.md` describes, and without one. After
it, choosing a pin or a list item opens that site's narrative page, with a way
back to the same spot on the map.

**Done when** it works for every fixture site with a mouse, a keyboard and a
phone.

### M5 · The map on a phone

**Workstream:** Map and discovery. **Status:** Later. Needs M1.

**Goal.** The project expects many readers to arrive from a link on their
phone. The map and the list work with a thumb: pins large enough to tap, and
the list reachable without fighting the map.

**Done when** someone who hasn't seen the app can find a named site on a phone
without help.

### N5 · How a narrative page reads the graph

**Workstream:** Narrative page. **Status:** Ready

**Goal.** How claims are weighed is still open, so this workstream designs how
the page reads as well as building it, and N1 carries on against the stand-in
data in the fixtures. This story is the design half: a short document, in your
own words, on how a reader should experience the claim graph on a narrative
page. Questions to answer or argue: how claims show which matters more without
showing a score; how a chain of extensions reads; how a disagreement looks
next to the detail it's about; how a record shows who brought it; and how a
mention of a date, a place or a person inside a claim might work. Disagreeing
with `PAGE-MODEL.md` is welcome.

**Done when** the document is in the fork, the sponsor has read it, and
anything that would change the shared model is raised in the questions issue.
Where it touches an open question in `docs/DESIGN-QUESTIONS.md`, it links to
it and treats it as open.

**Not in this story.** Showing scores, counts or rankings to readers.

### N4 · Show where a record came from

**Workstream:** Narrative page. **Status:** Later. Needs N1, De7, and
collections in the contract (see "What does a collection carry?" in
`docs/DESIGN-QUESTIONS.md`).

**Goal.** The archivists said where a record came from is what matters most
to them. On a narrative page, each record shows the profile that handed it
over and the collection it came in, with a link to the rest of that
collection.

**Done when** it works on the corner shop with fixture data.

**Not in this story.** Anything about who a profile is.

### De4 · Say where people go to have their story kept (Michael)

**Workstream:** Design. **Status:** Ready

**Goal.** The archivists asked why anyone would use this instead of donating
to an archive directly. The landing page answers that before a visitor has to
ask: the project is built around places, it turns up people, records and
leads, and someone who wants their material kept permanently is pointed to an
archive and donates there. It also says that here a contributor can change
their privacy settings, including taking something out of public view. That
choice is decided but not in the contract yet, so the copy describes it as
planned.

**Done when** the passage is in the landing page copy document
(`LANDING-PAGE-COPY.md`), the sponsor has approved it in the questions issue,
and it's on the page.

**Not in this story.** Naming any archive or organisation. A donation form or
any way of sending material anywhere.

### De5 · Say how stories are looked after (Michael)

**Workstream:** Design. **Status:** Ready

**Goal.** One of the archivists' questions was how the project is moderated.
The page says what the project has decided: memories are shown as memories,
with their sources; when people disagree, every version stays visible with
its own sources; and contributors choose what's public. None of that is built
yet, so the copy describes how the project works. It doesn't present any of
it as a live feature. Moderation isn't designed, so the copy promises nothing about it.

**Done when** the passage is in the copy document, the sponsor has approved
it, and it's on the page.

**Not in this story.** Any claim about moderation, review or verification
that the project hasn't decided. Scores, rankings or counts.

### De6 · Say who runs the project (Michael)

**Workstream:** Design. **Status:** Ready

**Goal.** The archivists' first questions weren't about the idea. They were
about who is behind the project and what the sponsor's company is. The page
answers that without anyone having to ask: who runs it, that it's free, and
that nothing on it is sold.

**Done when** the passage is in the copy document, the sponsor has approved
it, and it's on the page. If the copy names the sponsor's company, the content
test's allow-list gains that name on purpose, in the same pull request.

**Not in this story.** Naming any university, course or person.

### De7 · The components the map and a narrative page need (Michael)

**Workstream:** Design. **Status:** Ready

**Goal.** Design the parts the next stories build from: a pin and a site in
the list, a narrative page's header, a memory shown with its source, two
versions of a detail shown side by side when people disagree, and a record
shown with who brought it. Use the design tokens from De1, or start them if
De1 hasn't yet.

**Done when** each component has a design the team can build from, with its
states (empty, loading, a long name, a disagreement), and the team has
reviewed them. Anything the data can't support yet goes to the sponsor in the
questions issue.

**Not in this story.** Scores, rankings or counts.

### De8 · Readable for an older reader (Michael)

**Workstream:** Design. **Status:** Ready

**Goal.** The project expects many readers to be older and not technical.
Check the landing page and the components from De7 against that reader: type
size, contrast, how big things are to tap, and whether every label says what
it does.

**Done when** you've written down what you checked and changed, and one person
from outside the team who is over sixty has tried the landing page while you
watched.

**Not in this story.** A full accessibility audit. The landing page's
automated checks already cover the basics.

### De9 · From the landing page to the full app (Michael)

**Workstream:** Design. **Status:** Later. Needs P6 and P7.

**Goal.** Once the full app has a preview at its own address, the landing page
has a way to get there, worded so nobody mistakes the preview for a finished
app.

**Done when** the link and its copy are approved by the sponsor and on the
page.

### De10 · Does the full app have a home page? (Michael)

**Workstream:** Design. **Status:** Ready

**Goal.** Decide what someone sees first in the full app: a home page, or
straight into the map. Say why, with the reader described in the landing page
brief (in the questions issue) in mind.

**Done when** the decision and the reason are in a one-page decision record,
and the team has seen it.

---

## Sprint three, first batch

The map is the next big effort, and the narrative page is the focus after it,
so this batch starts with the map. Each map story comes with its data work and
its design, and they're built to run on data shaped like the real thing. The narrative stories take
the page on to the harder data the fixtures already carry, and narrative work
carries on alongside the map. The sponsor hasn't assigned anything. Pick owners as you
finish your current work.

Some of these use the freight depot, which came with contract 2.4.0. Your fork
is still on 2.3.0, so pull upstream first (issue #32).

### M6 · Neighbourhood shapes on the map

**Workstream:** Map and discovery. **Status:** Later. Needs M1, and the
boundary data, which the sponsor will provide.

**Goal.** Places sit inside neighbourhood shapes on the map. The sponsor has
decided that a home is shown at neighbourhood or subdivision level until the people it
affects choose otherwise, and public places are shown exactly. That part isn't
in the contract yet. This story draws the boundaries.

**Done when** the shapes draw on the map, the source and licence are credited
on the map itself, each fixture site falls inside the shape whose boundary
contains its coordinates, and it works on a phone and with or without a
Mapbox token, like M1.

**Not in this story.** Moving a home's pin to its neighbourhood. The contract
doesn't mark a place as a home yet, and that gets its own story once it does.

### Da9 · Neighbourhood shapes in the read model

**Workstream:** Data. **Status:** Later. Needs Da5, and the boundary data.
Matches M6.

**Goal.** The read model returns the neighbourhood boundaries, and for each
site, which shape it sits in. The map draws from this rather than from a file
of its own.

**Done when** M6 draws from it, and every fixture site comes back with the
neighbourhood whose boundary contains its coordinates.

### De11 · How the map shows neighbourhoods, and a home inside one

**Workstream:** Design. **Status:** Ready.

**Goal.** This is the design half of M6. Design how the shapes look on the
map, how a place sits inside its shape, how the map credits the source and
licence, and how a home shown at neighbourhood level looks different from a
public place shown at its exact spot, so a reader doesn't take a marker inside
the shape as the home's exact spot.

A home shown at neighbourhood level has to follow three rules, so build them
into the design:

- It shows in the same place every time. A random offset that moves on each
  view would give the real spot away to anyone who averaged enough views.
- The list matches the map: a home in the list names its neighbourhood,
  never a street address.
- Nothing on the map or in the list shows a home's address.

**Done when** the mockups are in the fork and the sponsor has seen them.

**Not in this story.** Deciding who can make a home's location exact. That's
still open.

### N6 · The freight depot as a page

**Workstream:** Narrative page. **Status:** Ready, once you've pulled
contract 2.4.0.

**Goal.** The freight depot (`packages/fixtures/fixtures/freight-depot/events.ts`)
is the fixture with the most cases in it: a recording in French, translations
that disagree, a recording transcribed one part at a time, a link backing an
extension, an upload still processing, and an open report (somebody flagged a
record and nobody has looked at it yet). Render it with the page N1 built, and
find out what the page can't show yet.

**Done when** the freight depot renders at t0 to t3 without errors, and the
pull request lists what's missing, each item linked to a story below or
raised in the questions issue.

**Not in this story.** Deciding how a reported record or an unfinished upload
looks.

### N7 · A claim in another language, with its translations

**Workstream:** Narrative page. **Status:** Later. Needs N6 and contract
2.5.0, which changes how translations are stored.

**Goal.** The project expects many of its readers to have family history in
another language. A claim given in French shows its English translation, says
it's a translation, and the reader can open the original words. When two
translations disagree, the page shows both, and neither replaces the original.

**Done when:**

- At t1, the French claim shows that it's waiting for a translation.
- From t2, it shows its translation, labelled, and the reader can open the
  original.
- At t3, the claim shows both of its translations side by side, with the
  dispute on the first one and its reasoning.
- Nothing on the page ranks a claim lower, or marks it as less reliable,
  because it was translated.

**Not in this story.** Translating anything, or deciding which translation is
right.

### N8 · A recording transcribed one part at a time

**Workstream:** Narrative page. **Status:** Later. Needs N6 and contract
2.5.0, which changes how transcripts are stored.

**Goal.** Contributors transcribe a long recording a piece at a time. The page
shows which parts can be read, by their start and end times, and marks the
rest as not transcribed yet. A claim that cites a part with no transcript
still shows, and says it's waiting for one.

**Done when:**

- At t1, the claim citing the recording shows, and says it's waiting for a
  transcript.
- From t2, the recording shows its transcribed part, 0:18 to 1:10, and marks
  the rest as not transcribed yet.
- It works from the keyboard.

**Not in this story.** An audio player that follows along with the
transcript.

### N9 · A link record and its preview

**Workstream:** Narrative page. **Status:** Later. Needs N6 and contract
2.5.0.

**Goal.** In contract 2.5.0 a link record carries a preview: a title and a
short summary, both typed by the contributor. Sagas fetches nothing from the
linked page. The page shows the preview and the link, says the contributor
wrote the summary, and opens the linked page in a new tab.

**Done when** the freight depot's link, at t2, shows its preview this way.

**Not in this story.** Fetching anything from the linked page, thumbnails, or
checking whether the link still works.

## Epic A — Foundations (the original first sprint)

Five pieces that can run in parallel, one per person. Together they let
everything after this be built by several people at once.

### A1 · Component library for the renderer

**Status:** Ready

**Goal.** The shared building blocks every view uses, so five people build the
same page from the same parts.

**Done when:**

- `src/components/ui` holds the generic pieces the first views need: at least
  text styles, a button, a card or panel, a tag or label, a tooltip, and a
  dialog.
- Colours, spacing and type sizes are defined once, as design tokens (named
  values like `--space-2` or `text-muted`), and components use the tokens rather
  than raw values.
- Every component meets the colour contrast level of the Web Content
  Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, level AA, and every interactive one works
  from the keyboard.
- Nothing in `src/components/ui` imports from `@sagas/contracts`. If it needs to
  know what a claim is, it belongs in `src/features`.
- A short `src/components/ui/README.md` says what exists and how to add to it.

**Not in this story.** Sagas-specific components such as a claim or a dispute.
Those come in epic C and are built from these.

**Worth knowing.** `src/components/ui` already follows the shadcn/ui convention
for where primitives live, as its README explains. You are free to use shadcn/ui
or not. Decide as a team and write down why.

### A2 · Front-end test setup

**Status:** Ready

**Goal.** A test can render a component. Today only the pure functions beside
the components are tested.

**Done when:**

- The Vitest setup in `apps/web` is extended so a test can render a React
  component and query what it shows. Testing Library is the usual choice. Pick
  it or something else and say why.
- An automated accessibility check runs in at least one component test. Which
  library does it is your choice. Write down why.
- The existing `IntegrityBadge` and `ConfidenceIndicator` tests still pass, and
  there is one new rendering test for each as an example.
- `pnpm --filter @sagas/web test` runs everything, and the output shows the new
  tests actually ran. A test file outside Vitest's include list is skipped
  silently while the run still reports success, so check the count.

**Not in this story.** End-to-end browser tests. Those can come later.

**Worth knowing.** Test what a component does. "A thin record is never described
as failing" is worth a test. "This div has this class" breaks every time
somebody improves the design.

### A3 · Storybook investigation

**Status:** Ready. Time-boxed to a few days.

**Goal.** Find out whether Storybook is worth adopting here before anybody
depends on it. `/dev` already does part of its job.

**Done when:** a short write-up, in the pull request or a markdown file,
answering:

- What it takes to run Storybook in this repository: Next 15, Tailwind, a pnpm
  workspace. What had to be installed or configured.
- Whether a Mapbox map can render inside it, and what that needs.
- Whether the fixture states and their acceptance criteria can sit beside each
  component the way they do on `/dev`.
- A recommendation: adopt it, or keep `/dev`.

If adopting is cheap, a working setup with one story for `IntegrityBadge` is a
good end point. If it is not, the write-up alone is a complete result.

**Not in this story.** Stories for every component.

### A4 · Mockups for the first tasks

**Status:** Ready

**Goal.** Agree what the first screens look like before building them.

**Done when:** mockups, sketched or in a design tool, for:

- The map with a search bar, and what happens when you pick a result (see B2).
- A site page at `t0` (one contributor, nothing corroborated) and at `t3`
  (several source records with claims, a dispute, a translation).
- One source record and the claims made from it, including a detail that
  somebody disputes.
- A short note with each screen saying what a person sees when they are the
  only contributor at a place.

**Not in this story.** Final visual design. These are for arguing with.

**Read first.** `docs/HOW-THE-LAYERS-FIT.md` and the fixture README section
"What your interface has to handle".

### A5 · Entity relationship model from the reading side

**Status:** Ready

**Goal.** Decide what your database holds, shaped for drawing a map and a page.

**Done when:**

- A diagram of the entities a page needs (sites, sections, source and
  evidence records, claims and their details, disputes, extensions, renderings,
  contributors) and how they relate.
- A note on what is stored ready to draw versus worked out per request. Example:
  whether a site's list of sections is stored or built on each read.
- A first migration in `apps/ui-api` that creates the tables, run against the
  local database started with `pnpm db:up`. There is no migration tool in
  `apps/ui-api` yet, so choosing one is part of this story. Write down why.

**Not in this story.** Loading the fixture data into it (C0), and matching the
other layers' schemas, which is not a goal.

**Worth knowing.** "Conversation" is a working idea that may be dropped, so do
not model it as its own table. Group claims by source record, and take sections
from the shared contract.

---

## Epic B — Finding a place

The map and the list. Concrete work that can start as soon as A1 has a few
components.

### B1 · Mapbox map with the fixture sites as pins(Sam)

**Status:** Ready

**Goal.** Replace the TODO in `src/features/map/MapView.tsx` with a real map.

**Done when:**

- With `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN` set, the map renders every site from
  `listSites()` as a pin, centred on the sites.
- With no token, `MapUnavailable` still renders the list. Both paths work.
- Pins show at a glance whether a place is thinly or well documented, using the
  band from `IntegrityBadge`. No number is shown.
- Clicking a pin opens that site's page.

**Worth knowing.** `mapbox-gl` is already a dependency. Coordinates are
`[longitude, latitude]`. Each person registers their own free token, and nobody
commits one.

### B2 · Search bar that finds an address and drops a pin

**Status:** Later. Needs B1.

**Goal.** Somebody types an address or a place name and the map goes there.

**Done when:**

- A search field on the map suggests matches as you type.
- Choosing one moves the map there and drops a pin.
- The fixture sites in view stay visible as pins after the search, so a site
  near the result is one click away.
- It works from the keyboard and with a screen reader.

**Part of the story:** find out which Mapbox service does address search, what
its free allowance is, and whether results may be stored. Write down what you
found and where you found it.

**Not in this story.** Creating a new site from the dropped pin. Creating sites
is not part of this layer's work.

### B3 · The list view has everything the map has(Sam)

**Status:** Ready

**Goal.** Somebody who cannot use the map loses nothing.

**Done when:**

- A list view shows every site the map shows, and it is reachable whether or not
  a Mapbox token is set. `MapUnavailable` is where it starts.
- A search field filters the list by site name, other names (`aka`) and address.
  This searches the fixture data, so it works with no Mapbox token.
- Each entry says in words how well documented the place is.

### B4 · Only load the sites in view

**Status:** Later. Needs A5 and C0.

**Goal.** The map asks only for the sites inside the visible area.

**Done when:** `listSites()` takes a bounding box, the database answers it with
a spatial index, and panning the map loads new sites. See `docs/GIS.md`.

---

## Epic C — The narrative page

How the claims at a site become a page. `apps/web/DIRECTION.md` has what is
decided and what is open. These first stories render what the fixture already
has.

### C0 · Load the fixture states into your database

**Status:** Later. Needs A5.

**Goal.** `packages/read-model` reads from Postgres instead of JSON files.

**Done when:** a seed script loads every fixture state, the read functions query
the database, and `/dev` looks the same as before.

### C1 · Render one source record and its claims

**Status:** Later. Needs a few A1 components and the A4 mockup of one source
record.

**Goal.** The source record and the claims made from it, readable in order.

**Done when:**

- A component takes a source record and its claims and renders them, using A1's
  components.
- Each claim shows who made it and when.
- It renders against all four states on `/dev` without looking broken at `t0`.

### C2 · Disputes on a detail

**Status:** Later. Needs C1.

**Goal.** When somebody disputes one detail of a claim, the disagreement shows
at that detail and the rest of the claim reads as undisputed.

**Done when:**

- `src/features/article/DetailDisputes.tsx` shows every reading of the disputed
  detail, each with its reasoning and who gave it.
- The claim's own reading stays in place in the sentence, and the competing
  readings sit visibly beside it. Nothing marks either as the answer, and there
  is no vote count.
- A dispute with reasoning but no proposed value still shows, as an objection
  to the detail with its reasoning.

See "Disagreement lands on one detail" in
`packages/fixtures/README.md`. The corner shop site at `t2` has a clean example.

### C3 · Where a claim comes from

**Status:** Later. Needs C1.

**Goal.** Every claim reaches the person who made it, its source record, and any
evidence records attached to it.

**Done when:** `src/features/article/SourcePanel.tsx` shows these, and a claim
whose author is not the person who handed over the record makes that clear.

### C4 · Translations and transcripts side by side

**Status:** Later. Needs C1.

**Goal.** A claim with no English rendering is readable in its original, and a
claim with several renderings shows all of them, credited.

**Done when:** `src/features/article/TranslationPanel.tsx` handles no rendering,
one, and several, as its own comment describes.

---

## Epic D — Suggestion

**Status:** Draft. Starts with a design exercise. Code comes after it.

How a reader is pointed at what to read next and what they could add. The
routing that decides this belongs to the intelligence layer and does not exist
yet, so this epic designs the interface against invented signals first. The
passover interaction joins this epic once the design exercise is done.

### D1 · Design exercise: the suggestion interface

**Status:** Draft. Gets detail at the first specification meeting.

**Goal.** A proposal for how the interface suggests content to a reader,
worked through the way a product design exercise is: who the user is, what they
are trying to do, what the system knows, and what the screen does about it.

**The brief.** Think of designing a site like Reddit, with the
constraints this project adds. There are no vote counts and no scores shown to
anyone. Agreement is not evidence. A claim nobody has responded to is not
doubted, it just has not reached anyone who knows. What does a reader see that
makes them want to read on, and makes somebody who knows something want to
add it?

**Done when:** mockups plus a page of reasoning, brought to a specification
meeting. Stories to build it come out of that meeting.

---

## Epic E — References

**Status:** Draft.

How claims, records and renderings cite each other on the page, and how
somebody links to one claim. See `apps/web/DIRECTION.md`. Stories get written
once C1 and C3 exist.

# P4: Hosting the full app

- **For:** the sponsor's hosting decision on 8 November 2026
- **Workstream:** Platform. **Issues:** P4 #34; the address is P6 #35
- **Status:** Final. Two checks wait on database access, which the sponsor is setting up on 7–8 November: CPU time on Cloudflare itself, and a Worker reaching the database. The test Worker runs both in the first days of the following week. The other layers are confirmed later, against the teams' real code.
- **Research:** 30 October to 6 November 2026. Retested on `main` at contract 2.7.0 on 6 November
- **Currency:** USD; standard pricing; taxes and currency conversion excluded

## Recommendation

**What's asked on Sunday:** the platform, and the $5 account base. How each layer fits, and what the whole project costs to run, are confirmed as the other teams' code becomes available.

1. **Host the full app on Cloudflare Workers,** as a second Worker beside `sagas-landing` on the sponsor's account, deployed only by GitHub Actions. At the assumed baseline traffic it fits Workers Free, if its requests stay within Free's CPU limit and the account's busiest day stays under 100,000 requests.
2. **Host the other layers on the same account:**
   - their web apps and APIs as Workers;
   - their files in R2;
   - media processing (`ffprobe`, `ffmpeg`) in a Cloudflare Container.

   Containers need Workers Paid, which gives the account a **shared base of $5 a month.** The total also depends on several things that the account's web traffic can't predict:
   - how long media processing runs;
   - how many files are kept, and how often they're read and written;
   - how much is transcribed and translated;
   - what the other layers' real code needs.

3. **Transcription can avoid a container,** if the content team picks a model that Workers AI runs, such as Whisper, at $0.0005 per audio minute. The content team chooses the models.
4. **Move to Next.js 16** in its own pull request, before the full app is published (P7).
5. **Decide on Sunday, then confirm with the test Worker.** The sponsor decides from this proposal on 8 November. Once database access is up, the test Worker checks that a Worker can reach the database. If it can't, the decision is looked at again, with **Render** as the fallback. Render's starting prices are known: $7 a month per service.

The app stays portable whichever host is chosen. It reaches the database through `packages/read-model` on standard Postgres, and host settings stay out of feature code, so Render or any other Node host remains possible.

## 1. The full app on Cloudflare Workers

**It works in Cloudflare's runtime.** On 6 November, `main` was moved to Next.js 16.4.5. It was built with the OpenNext adapter for Cloudflare (1.20.16) and run in `workerd`, Cloudflare's runtime, against Postgres seeded with the fixtures. The results:

- **Every route answered:** `/`, `/dev`, `/api/sites` and `/api/sites/[slug]`, which are all the routes the app has. The site pages (`/sites/<slug>`) aren't built yet.
- **Twelve simultaneous first requests** to a fresh Worker all succeeded.
- **In a browser,** the pages behaved exactly as under plain Node.
- **The bundle** is 5.0 MiB, against a 64 MiB limit.
- **Earlier runs** on Next.js 15.5.28 (30 October), and on a second machine, gave the same picture.

**These are local wall times, not Cloudflare's CPU time.** Wall time includes waiting on the database, which Cloudflare doesn't count as CPU. The times were also measured on a shared machine, not Cloudflare's. So they show which routes to measure once deployed, and the test Worker measures the real CPU. Cloudflare ends a Worker that keeps going over 10 ms of CPU. If pages rendered on each request do, there are two remedies:

- **Build site pages ahead of time.** Fixture data changes only on deploy, so stored pages cut the rendering work.
- **Use Workers Paid,** which raises the limit to 30 seconds per request. The containers need Paid anyway, so once the other layers arrive, the 10 ms limit stops mattering.

**A reminder about `/dev`:** `apps/web/README.md` and the SRS draft call it a development tool, and the page itself says to replace it once there's something better. So we propose:

- **On the fixture preview (P7):** keep `/dev` available. It's where the article can be shown to the sponsor.
- **On the eventual public site:** disable it, with the setting and the check in change 3 below. A line in the README says where it runs.
- **The article's public home is the site pages (M4).** We plan to prerender the shared fixture site pages; their rendering and cache behaviour will be verified when M4 is implemented.
  - Views as of a chosen time, and personalised interactions, need their own design.
  - Passover writes can stay separate dynamic requests. They don't need the whole article rendered again.

**Passovers will need writes.** The planned passover interaction stores passovers with anonymous guest IDs, in the experience layer's own tables (Da8). Recording them isn't built yet: Da10 leaves it to that interaction. So:

- the app's database user will need write access to those tables;
- each passover is a request that runs when someone acts, and can't be built ahead of time. Its CPU and database time remain to be measured, and it isn't in the cost model yet.

**What the app needs before it's published (P7):**

1. **Versions:** Next.js 16.4.5 or later, with adapter `@opennextjs/cloudflare` 1.20.16. The adapter's minimum Next.js version rises with Next.js security releases, so Next.js has to be kept patched.
2. **The database driver:** `pg` and `pg-cloudflare` as the app's own dependencies, and in `serverExternalPackages`. Without this, every database call fails in a Worker.
3. **`/dev`:**
   - **On the preview:** it reads the fixture index from the repository on every request, and a deployed Worker doesn't have that file. Bundle the index, or read the list from the read model.
   - **For the public site:** a setting that rejects `/dev` requests on the server, before any fixture loads. A test requests `/dev` directly with the setting off, rather than only checking that its links are hidden.
4. **The static-assets cache:** pages built ahead of time are served from it, in about 2 ms instead of about 16. It is read-only, so changed pages need a redeploy, which suits fixture data.
5. **Ignore files:** `.open-next/` and `.wrangler/` stay out of git and lint.

**The build needs a database,** because `next build` renders the home page from Postgres. CI starts its own Postgres and seeds it, which is the CI database job already planned. CI's database ends with the job, so at runtime the Worker uses the hosted database. The read model loads once, inside the first request, and closes its connection, which Workers allow. Anything that queries on every request, such as a passover or Da5's map data, must create its database client inside that request.

## 2. Can a Worker reach the database?

**Nothing in principle blocks it:**

- Worker sockets reach public addresses over TCP, with TLS.
- Supabase's pooler accepts IPv4 connections, on every plan.

**What depends on the sponsor's settings:**

- **Network Restrictions.** If they're on, the ranges they allow decide the route. Cloudflare's published IP ranges can't be used to reliably allow-list direct Worker socket connections. Hyperdrive works if Cloudflare's published ranges are allowed, and Render works once its outbound ranges are.
- **"Enforce SSL on incoming connections."** It doesn't change the route. The app connects encrypted either way; the setting only decides whether the database also refuses unencrypted connections.

**The plan:**

1. **The sponsor decides on Sunday,** from this proposal.
2. **The test Worker confirms the connection** in the first days of next week, once access is up. It also measures CPU, and runs a query with `$1` parameters, as passover writes will.
   - `pg`'s ordinary parameterized queries are expected to work through the transaction pooler.
   - Named prepared statements aren't supported there, so the app doesn't use them.
3. **If the test Worker can't reach the database,** the sponsor looks at the decision again, with Render as the fallback (#11, 6 November).

**The database layout** (sponsor, #11, 6 November):

- **One Supabase project, with one shared model:** the one in `packages/contracts/src/model.ts`.
- **Tables a layer needs only for itself** go in that layer's own Postgres schema, beside the shared tables.
- **On Supabase Free, the 500 MB limit is shared by all three layers,** so media files belong in R2, not the database.

**Still open, answered by the sponsor in #11 when he sets up access this weekend:**

- [ ] Network Restrictions: on or off, and which ranges they allow.
- [ ] "Enforce SSL on incoming connections": on or off.
- [ ] The plan. Free projects pause after a week without activity.
- [ ] How the connection details reach the team. They have two destinations:
  - **CI:** a GitHub repository secret, for the deploy job;
  - **the running Worker:** a Worker secret or a Hyperdrive configuration. The pipeline can set a Worker secret with the existing token.

## 3. Hosting all three layers

This lists each layer's parts, from the upstream starter code. The other teams' real code is seen at the meetings in the week of 16 November, so this is a plan to confirm, not a commitment.

**Checks to agree with the content team:**

- **Dispatch:** how a job reaches the media container, with retries and shutdown. Queues would be a design choice to make with them, not a given.
- **Long recordings** probably need `ffmpeg` to extract and split the audio before transcription. The model's input limit has to be checked.
- **The model choice is theirs.** Upstream says checking each model's licence is part of their job (`apps/capture-api/README.md`). A model not on Workers AI would run in a container, on CPU only: Cloudflare's container limits list no GPUs, so it would be slower than Workers AI.

**Workers Paid is per account.**

- **Workers:** every Worker on it shares one allowance of 10 million requests and 30 million CPU-milliseconds a month.
- **Containers:** billed separately, against their own included amounts (above). The Worker and Durable Object in front of each container count as Workers and Durable Objects usage.

Usage shows per Worker in the dashboard, and each Worker's CPU can be capped. The landing page is on the same account, and its static files cost nothing.

## 4. Render, rechecked

- **Instances:** $7 a month for 0.5 CPU and 512 MB. The next size is $25, for 1 CPU and 2 GB.
- **Bandwidth:** since 1 August 2026, the Hobby workspace includes 5 GB of outbound a month (it was 100 GB). Each GB beyond costs $0.15.
- **The full app:** at the assumed baseline, $7 is not tight on bandwidth: 1.6 GB of the 5 GB. Whether 0.5 CPU keeps up at peaks is untested. At 100×, it's about $30, and the extra is bandwidth, not a bigger instance.
- **All layers, as a sizing scenario:** every always-on service is its own $7. The app, `capture-api`, `graph-api` and the media worker come to $28 a month before bandwidth.
  - This assumes each fits in 512 MB and that `capture-web` needs no server of its own. The media worker's size is untested.
  - Render has no object storage, so files would still need R2.
  - A transcription model needs more than 512 MB; Workers AI can be called from Render instead.
- **Free web services:**
  - they sleep after 15 idle minutes, and take about a minute to wake;
  - Render may suspend one that sends unusually high traffic over the internet, including to an external database.
- **Deploying from GitHub Actions:** build a container image in Actions, where the CI database is, push it to a registry, and deploy that image to Render with a deploy hook stored as a repository secret. Render's Auto-Deploy stays off. If Render built the app from Git instead, its own build would need a database it can reach.
- **Why it's the fallback:** it runs the app as it is, as a plain Node server with no adapter, and its outbound IP ranges can be allow-listed.

## 5. The move to Next.js 16

- **Agreed** at the 6 November meeting. Next.js 15 gets security releases until 31 January 2027, extended from 21 October 2026.
- **Its own pull request, before P7,** with a decision record, since it affects every workstream.
- **Tested on 6 November on `main`** (contract 2.7.0), with 16.4.5:
  - typecheck, lint, acceptance and every test pass (web 28, landing 109, fixtures 162, graph-api 8);
  - the Cloudflare build needs no override;
  - the browser check matches plain Node.

  The 30 October run on 16.4.2 agreed. Node isn't a concern: CI uses 22.10.0, and 16 needs 20.9 or later.

- **Before merging,** repeat those checks on the 16.x that's current then, including cold starts.
- **Question for the sponsor: does upstream move to 16 too?** If the fork moves first, every upstream sync conflicts on `package.json` and the lockfile.

## 6. Alternatives considered

At standard pricing, as the sponsor asked (#11, 6 November). Vercel is excluded by #34.

| Oracle Cloud Always Free     | One VM with 2 OCPUs and 12 GB, 200 GB of disk and 10 TB of outbound a month: the whole stack in Docker Compose                                              | Cut in half on 15 June 2026, so its free terms can change.

| Netlify                      | Next.js through its adapter                                                                                                                                 | Every project pauses when the month's credits run out. About $60 a month at 100× for the full app. Fixed outbound addresses, which a restricted database would need, are an Enterprise add-on                                                                   |

**Bottom line:** on current evidence and standard prices, Cloudflare is the preferred platform:

- it's a low shared base on the sponsor's existing account, where the deploy token and the domain already are: $5 a month for every layer's Workers;
- the free options trade money for server work (Oracle), or are free only until traffic grows (Cloud Run, Cloudflare Free).

## 7. Cost

**The full app.** It isn't published, so the cost model uses an **assumed baseline:** the sponsor's whole Cloudflare account over 30 days, 12,110 requests, each treated as one page view of the app. That's about 400 views a day at 1×, and 40,000 at 100×. One page view was measured at 7 Worker requests and about 129 KiB on a first visit. Appendix B has the model and its assumptions.

Reading the 12,110 as requests rather than page views lowers every figure, but the order stays the same: Cloudflare $0–5, Render $24.85, Netlify $30. The numbers are recalculated once the preview gives real traffic.

These are starting points. The total depends on the media processed, the files kept, the audio transcribed and the text translated, and on what the other layers' real code needs.

## 8. What happens next

| When                       | What                                                                                                               | Who                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| 7–8 Nov                    | Database access, and answers in #11: the settings, the plan, and how the connection details arrive                 | Sponsor             |
| 8 Nov                      | Decision on the platform and the account base, from this proposal                                                  | Sponsor             |
| Early in the week of 9 Nov | The test Worker: a connection to Supabase, CPU on Cloudflare, and a query with `$1` parameters. Then it's removed  | Platform, with Data |
| Week of 9 Nov              | The CI database job, and the Next.js 16 pull request                                                               | Platform            |
| After both pass            | P7 publishes the full app; P6 gives it its address on `sagasproject.org`                                           | Platform            |
| Week of 16 Nov             | Meet the other teams. Turn section 3 into a plan for their real code, including how jobs reach the media container | Team                |

If the test Worker can't reach the database, the sponsor looks at the decision again, with Render as the fallback.

## Appendix A: Evidence

**Next.js 16.4.5, adapter 1.20.16, `main` at contract 2.7.0 (6 November).** Local `workerd`, against Postgres 16 seeded with the 24 fixture states. Warm requests, after the first:

| Route                       | Median / p95 | Max   |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | ----- |
| `/` (from the cache)        | 2 / 3 ms     | 4 ms  |
| `/api/sites`                | 2 / 3 ms     | 6 ms  |
| `/api/sites/freight-depot`  | 3 / 4 ms     | 6 ms  |
| `/dev`, freight depot t0–t3 | 18 / 22 ms   | 28 ms |

- **Twelve simultaneous first requests:** all succeeded, in 0.02–0.38 s.
- **Bundle:** 5,083 KiB uncompressed (1,070 KiB gzip), against a 64 MiB limit. Cloudflare removed the compressed limit on 4 September 2026.
- **CI:** a clean install, the fixtures, typecheck, lint, acceptance and tests across the workspace all passed.

**Earlier runs:**

| Run                                                               | `/`                                            | APIs       | `/dev` article          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| Next.js 15.5.28, adapter 1.20.13 (30 October)                     | 2.5 / 4 ms; 16 / 20 ms when rendered each time | 3 / 4–5 ms | 15 / 22 ms              |
| Next.js 16.4.2, adapter 1.20.12 (30 October)                      | 2 / 4 ms                                       | 2 / 4–5 ms | 18 / 22 ms              |
| Second machine (WSL, the team's Docker database), Next.js 15.5.28 | 4–6 ms                                         | 4–6 ms     | 11–16 ms (median 12–13) |

**What the runs show:**

- **Data barely matters.** On the second machine, `/dev` took nearly the same time for the lightest fixture (corner shop at t0) and the richest (freight depot at t3): 12 against 13 ms. Most of the time goes to rendering the page, not its data.
- **The browser check matched plain Node,** on both 15.5.28 and 16.4.5:
  - the pages render, and query parameters choose the site and state;
  - client-side navigation, refresh and the back button work;
  - a missing page and an unknown site both give 404.

  Both runtimes showed the same 404s for prefetches of `/sites/<slug>`, links to pages that aren't built yet (M4 adds them).

**How it was run:**

1. Postgres 16 on port 5435, seeded with `pnpm --filter @sagas/ui-api db:seed`.
2. The five changes in section 1, with `open-next.config.ts` and a local-only `wrangler.jsonc` (flags `nodejs_compat` and `global_fetch_strictly_public`).
3. `opennextjs-cloudflare build`, then `opennextjs-cloudflare populateCache local`.
4. The bundle measured with `wrangler deploy --dry-run`, which uploads nothing.
5. The app served with `wrangler dev`. The timings came from its request traces, and the browser check used Playwright's Chromium.

Nothing was deployed, and no account was used.

## Appendix B: Cost model

**Inputs:**

- **Traffic (sponsor, #11, 2 November):** 12,110 requests, 4,990 Worker invocations, no errors, and a CPU p90 of 569 µs over 30 days, for the whole account.
  - Cloudflare can't show `sagas-landing` alone, and the busiest day (11 October) was before the landing page went live.
  - These are not page views, and the p90 is not an average to multiply. Treating each request as a page view is a planning assumption.
- **Per page view (measured locally):**
  - 7 Worker requests: the page, plus Next.js prefetching the 6 site links on it (8 on the home page);
  - 14 requests in all on a first visit;
  - about 129 KiB on a first visit (0.4–10 KiB on a repeat).

  The 6 prefetches are of site pages that don't exist yet, so today they return 404. Once those pages exist, and as interactions such as passovers arrive, the requests and bytes per view will change.

- **Assumed CPU per view, for pricing:**
  - 35 ms with pre-built pages: 7 requests at 5 ms each (5 ms rounds up the local p95 for a cached page or an API call);
  - 46 ms with one page rendered on each request: 16 ms (the local median for the home page rendered each time), plus 6 requests at 5 ms.

  These are assumptions, not measured limits. Twice as much CPU would add about $1 a month at 100×.

- **Deploys:** 7 merges changed app code from 3 October to 2 November; 20 is also shown.

|            | 1× (about 400 views a day)                                     | 100× (about 40,000 views a day)                                                                                   |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cloudflare | $0 on Free: about 2,800 Worker requests a day, against 100,000 | $5.25–5.51 on Paid: 8.5 million requests (10 million included); 42–56 million CPU-ms (30 million included)        |
| Netlify    | 183 credits at 7 deploys (Free, 300); 378 at 20 (Personal, $9) | About 7,900–8,100 credits: Pro's base ($20 when checked on 3 November) plus four packs of 1,500 at $10, about $60 |
| Render     | $7: 1.6 GB of the 5 GB included                                | About $30: $7 plus 160 GB at $0.15 beyond 5 GB                                                                    |

- **Netlify's compute** assumes its default 1 GB and an unmeasured 50 ms per call.
- **Second reading,** with the 12,110 as the app's requests rather than page views (100 KiB each, 4 deploys, 100 ms per Netlify call):
  - Cloudflare: the average day fits Free even at 100×, at about 40,000 Worker requests. That holds only if the whole account's busiest day also stays under 100,000 requests, and every request within Free's CPU limit, which a low monthly volume can't settle.
  - Netlify: 91 and 3,119 credits, so $0 and $30.
  - Render: $7 and $24.85.
